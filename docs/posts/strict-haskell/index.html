  <h3>strict-haskell</h3>
  <h1 id="strict-haskell">Strict Haskell</h1>
<p>What would a strict version of Haskell look like? That is, a pure language
with syntax as close to Haskell as possible but where function application
and data constructors are evaluated strictly. Laziness should be accessible
through an explicit thunk datatype.
(Nikita Volkov has written a good explanation of the <a href="http://nikita-volkov.github.io/if-haskell-were-strict/">explicit thunk
datatype</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="what-problems-are-we-trying-to-solve">What problems are we trying to solve?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>There are a lot of implicit thunks floating around in Haskell. It is
anathema to treat <code>A -&gt; IO B</code> as if it were simply <code>A -&gt; B</code> so it seems
odd for <code>A</code> to mean a type of computations (returning values of type <code>A</code>)
rather than itself a type of values. Strict Haskell would be more honest
since thunks would be represented by an explicit type.</p></li>
<li><p>The need for <code>newtype</code> is symptomatic of the confusion introduced by
implicit thunks.</p></li>
<li><p>The need for <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/Control-Exception-Base.html#v:evaluate"><code>evaluate</code></a>
<code>:: a -&gt; IO a</code> is a wart which indicates that we do
not understand how to mix <code>IO</code> and forcing thunks.</p></li>
<li><p>When we have a function which releases some memory how can we ensure that
the release happens before the rest of the program continues execution?
<a href="http://web.jaguarpaw.co.uk/~tom/blog/posts/2013-03-29-avoiding-space-leaks-when-deleting-data.html">In the pure case it seems possible to use CPS</a>
and in IO it seems possible
to use <code>evaluate</code> (and probably the CPS form too) but is there a unified,
principled way? It seems unlikely that we will find one whilst thunks are
implicit.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of libraries (Lens, ST, Map, ByteString, Text) have strict and
lazy versions of functions or data structures. Lots of monads have
strict and lazy versions. This is very confusing. Is it really
necessary?</p></li>
<li><p>For a <code>Functor f</code>, a value <code>x :: f a</code> often contains one or several
thunks of type <code>a</code>. However, there is no general way to force these
thunks. If we apply a large number of <code>fmap</code>s to <code>x</code> then even if
we force <code>x</code> it doesn’t mean the thunks inside have been forced. We
can experience a space leak this way. This is a demonstration <code>seq</code>
is implicitly part of the interface of every data type, but it is
generally not treated that way by datatype authors.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="drawbacks-i-anticipate-with-strictness">Drawbacks I anticipate with strictness</h2>
<p>Note that monadic bind does not have an obvious drawback in a strict regime.
With <code>m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b</code> the <code>m b</code> need not actually run anything if
the <code>m a</code> short circuits, because it’s already hidden behind a function
(imagine <code>Maybe</code> for a prototypical case).</p>
<p>The <code>Applicative</code> instances will be potentially more problematic. With
<code>(&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code> it will be hard (syntactically at the
very least) to stop the <code>f a</code> computation from running, even if the <code>f (a -&gt; b)</code> short circuits. It will also only make sense to use lazy <code>Traversible</code>
instances. Mapping an <code>Applicative</code> value creating function over an entire
<code>Traversible</code> is a waste when it is followed by a <code>sequence</code> which can short
circuit. Perhaps the true nature of <code>(&lt;*&gt;)</code> is <code>LazyTuple (f (a -&gt; b), f a) -&gt; f b</code>.</p>
<p>Is Haskell’s <code>IO</code> itself lazy out of necessity? Maybe. Consider a pure
function containing an expression <code>let x = f y :: IO A</code>. Then <code>x</code> is an
<code>IO</code> action ready to be run, but not run yet! <code>IO</code> certainly contains some
sort of delaying and I don’t understand the importance of this to the whole
strict Haskell issue.</p>
<h2 id="hughes">Hughes</h2>
<p>Would this language be worse than Haskell? <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html">Hughes talks about the
importance of laziness for
modularity</a> but I
think that the issues he raises only actually apply to lazy data
structures.</p>
<h2 id="augustsson">Augustsson</h2>
<p><a href="http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/more-points-for-lazy-evaluation-in.html">Augustsson raises some important
points</a>,
though a lot of his examples are based on the behaviour of <code>error</code>
which in my opinion is just wrong. <code>error</code> is an effect and has no
place in pure code.</p>
<h3 id="lazy-bindings">Lazy bindings</h3>
<p>The “error” example is just wrong. The <code>\a -&gt; a + expensive</code> example can be
solved in a strict language through an explicit thunk data structures.</p>
<h3 id="lazy-functions">Lazy functions</h3>
<p>Augustsson’s charge of lazy functions is a harder one to answer. Again he
levels the false criticism of <code>error</code>, but the point still stands. I think
his idea of using {exp} for a thunk that when called evaluates exp is a good
one.</p>
<h3 id="lazy-constructors">Lazy constructors</h3>
<p>I don’t understand Augustsson’s point about lazy constructors. Does “lazy
constructor” mean “lazy datatype”?</p>
<h3 id="cyclic-data-structures">Cyclic data structures</h3>
<p>I think these are solvable with explicit thunks.</p>
<h3 id="reuse">Reuse</h3>
<p>I don’t understand Augustsson’s point here at all. His “biggest gripe” is
about composability, but it seems trivially solvable with lazy data
structures. He does seem to realise this: in the comments he says “It
doesn’t matter if ‘or’ and ‘map’ are overloaded for different kinds of
collections, it’s still wrong for strict collections”.</p>
<p>Bob Harper makes an interesting point in the comments:</p>
<p>‘In my mind however the conditional branch is not an example of [laziness].
The expression “if e then e1 else e2” is short-hand for a case analysis,
which binds a variable (of unit type) in each branch. So the conditional is
not “lazy” at all; rather, it is an instance of the general rule that we do
not evaluate under binders (ie, evaluate only closed code).’</p>
<h2 id="kmett">Kmett</h2>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265392/why-is-lazy-evaluation-useful/265548#265548">Edward Kmett raises some good
points</a>
and some that I don’t understand.</p>
<p>I think one thing that he is hinting at is that in <code>m &gt;&gt;= f</code> the tail call
is not <code>f</code>, rather <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code>. Thus if <code>m</code> is evaluated strictly (in our
setup, that corresponds to “not wrapped in a thunk”) and is a large chain of
calls of the same structure, then a lot of stack space will be consumed.
(Kmett mentions traversable rather than a chain of monadic binds, but I
suspect its the same issue).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1pjjy5/odersky_the_trouble_with_types_strange_loop_2013/cd3bgcu">Kmett later reiterated the issue and mentioned similar ones</a>.
See the examples starting with</p>
<ul>
<li>“Monads are toys due to the aforementioned restriction.”</li>
<li>“You wind up with issues like SI-3295”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="equational-reasoning">Equational reasoning</h3>
<p>I don’t really understand how laziness (or probably more accurately,
non-strictness) is relevant to equational reasoning. I would like to find
some explicit examples. Perhaps “Theorems for Free”?</p>
<h3 id="value-restriction">Value restriction</h3>
<p>I really don’t understand the relevance of this at all.</p>
<h3 id="code-that-can-be-understood-in-pieces">Code that can be understood in pieces</h3>
<p>This is basically just lazy bindings. I get why it’s good, but would hope
to find a syntax which makes it less relevant.</p>
<h3 id="elegant-expression-of-certain-algorithms">Elegant expression of certain algorithms</h3>
<p>This is a lazy data structures only comment, as far as I can tell.</p>
<h3 id="control-structures">Control structures</h3>
<p>This is exactly the same as Augustsson’s point above.</p>
<h3 id="monads">Monads</h3>
<p>Kmett claims monads only work with laziness. I don’t understand this.</p>
<h2 id="being-lazy-with-class">Being Lazy with Class</h2>
<p>The “Being Lazy With Class” paper mentions two important uses of laziness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursive datastructures – this is the same as Augustsson’s “cyclic data
structures argument” but better made. Is this easily replaceable with a
lightweight thunking syntax?</li>
<li>Unusual control flow – this is the same as Augusstson’s point, and
Kmett’s “Control Structures” point</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Don Syme notes in <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=79951">“Initializing Mutually Referential Abstract
Objects: The Value Recursion
Challenge”</a>
that “Wadler et al. describe techniques to add on-demand computations
to strict languages.”</p>
