  <h1 id="why-flexports-ceo-is-wrong-about-the-bottleneck-at-californias-ports">Why Flexport’s CEO is wrong about the bottleneck at California’s ports</h1>
<p>– by <a href="http://web.jaguarpaw.co.uk/~tom/contact">Tom Ellis</a> – 25th
October 2021</p>
<p>I recently read Eliyahu Goldratt’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_%28novel%29"><em>The
Goal</em></a>, a
“business novel” about how to increase capacity in a manufacturing
plant, whose lessons can be applied more widely, to logistics and
beyond. Over the last few days, themes from the book have been
playing out in public, particularly on Twitter, as a consequence of
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/visualizing-california-s-stunning-shipping-gridlock/ar-AAPRV60">the gridlock at California’s Los Angeles and Long Beach
ports</a>.
The CEO (Ryan Petersen) of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexport">Flexport</a> (a freight
forwarding and customs brokerage startup) has tweeted voluminously
about the logistical “bottlenecks” he has discovered on a couple of
intelligence-gathering expeditions, firstly <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1450904056365404160">to talk to dock
workers</a>
and secondly <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543776992845834">to observe dock operations from the
water</a>.</p>
<p>“Bottlenecks” (or “constraints”) are exactly what <em>The Goal</em> is about.
Given that I’ve read a book and I have critical thinking capacities I
deem myself suitably qualified to critique the CEO of a billion-dollar
logistics company. Let’s go!</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I don’t know anything about operations at Flexport. I
don’t know whether Petersen has taken the right or wrong <em>actions</em> or
<em>decisions</em> regarding his business and California’s ports. On the
other hand I am convinced the way that he <em>explained</em> the situation on
Twitter doesn’t make sense. That’s what this article is about.]</p>
<p>In <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1450904056365404160">the first
thread</a>
(about talking to the dock workers) Petersen explains that, although
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/us/politics/biden-port-los-angeles-supply-chain.html">the docks have started operating
24/7</a>,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1450904059305594884">trucks are not arriving
24/7</a>
to take away offloaded containers. In <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543776992845834">the second
thread</a>
(describing how he observed dock operations from the water) <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543782516740099">he claims
that</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>everyone now agrees that the bottleneck is yard space at the
container terminals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s his rationale for the claim that the bottleneck is yard space?
Well, it seems that there are currently a lot more imports from China
than exports to China so the trucks that took full containers from the
port are bringing back <em>empty</em> ones. Apparently you can’t get empty
containers off your dockyard by loading them onto ships because
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28973399">shipping companies are not being paid enough to take empty
containers</a> or because
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28973885">it’s dangerous to carry empty
containers</a>. Stacks of
empty containers are building up at ports leaving too little space for
ships to be unloaded. The problem compounds when truckers bringing
empty containers back to the port find no space to leave them, so they
can’t exchange their container for a full one, so full containers stay
at the port. An overload of containers is jamming up port operations,
empty containers cannot be removed by ship nor can full containers be
removed by truck!</p>
<p>Petersen concludes (and in a moment I’ll explain why I think he is
incorrect) that the bottleneck is yard space. His proposed solution
is for local and national government to act to allow trucking
companies to leave empty containers <em>elsewhere</em>, on large empty sites
around the locality (one imagines disused airfields etc.) leaving
space in the dockyard for unloading containers and space on trucks to
take full containers from the port.</p>
<p>In his analysis <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451547375768584194">Petersen explicitly recommends <em>The
Goal</em></a>
as “the most important business book ever written”. I wouldn’t dare
disagree with him. But I think he has applied the lessons of <em>The
Goal</em> incorrectly. Let’s look at some of his Twitter thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’re designing an operation you must choose your
bottleneck. If the bottleneck appears somewhere that you didn’t
choose it, you aren’t running an operation. It’s running you.
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543795045183490">[Source]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds edgy, thanks <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/134739-the-things-you-own-end-up-owning-you-it-s-only">Tyler
Durden</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should always choose the most capital intensive part of the line
to be your bottleneck. In a port that’s the ship to shore
cranes. The cranes should never be unable to run because they’re
waiting for another part of the operation to catch
up. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543796345356296">[Source]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds strange to me. You rarely get to <em>choose</em> your
bottleneck. The bottleneck is an emergent phenomenon. Perhaps some
highly skilled process engineers can <em>design</em> a bottleneck, but
generally a bottleneck is something you identify and manage.
Furthermore, however much skill you put into design you only ever
design the part of the system you control. The bottleneck may come
from another part of the system entirely, one you have limited control
over or insight into, such as a partner or the market itself.</p>
<p>Another way of putting Petersen’s statement “you should always choose
the most capital intensive part of the line to be your bottleneck” is
“you should always choose the bottleneck to be the most expensive part
to run”. But this confuses cause and effect! You should indeed only
make large capital outlays if they result in improving the flow
through the bottleneck; any other outlay is wasted. The factory that
features in <em>The Goal</em> has outlaid enormous amounts of capital on
robots, but they are not the bottleneck and no amount of trying to
reconfigure the system will make them the bottleneck. The capital
outlay on the robots was simply wasted.</p>
<p>Indeed in an efficient operation the bottleneck should always be the
most capital intensive component, but that’s because you chose to
invest capital in the bottleneck, not because you chose to bottleneck
your capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottleneck right now is not the cranes. It’s yard space at the
container terminals. And it’s empty chassis to come clear those
containers
out. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543797645647877">[Source]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree with either claimed bottleneck. I’ll tell you what I
think the bottleneck is presently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In operations when a bottleneck appears somewhere that you didn’t
design for it to appear, you must OVERWHELM THE BOTTLENECK!
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543798694166539">[Source]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Overwhelm the bottleneck”? “Overwhelm” is not a good word. What
does he mean? “Overwhelm” does not occur in Goldratt’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#The_five_focusing_steps">Five Focusing
Steps</a>
(which use the term “constraint” rather than “bottleneck”):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identify the constraint</p>
<p>There is normally only one “constraint” (or “bottleneck”) in a
system. It is the unique part of your process which constrains the
useful operation of every other component in the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploit the constraint</p>
<p>Make sure you are getting full capacity from the constraint. For
example, if it’s a machine, make sure it has no more idle time than
absolutely necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Subordinate everything to the constraint</p>
<p>There’s no point expending effort on increasing the capacity of
other components <em>except to the extent that their operation ensures
the constraint is kept fully exploited</em>. “Subordinating the
constraint” means making sure every other part of the system works
neither less nor more than is required to achieve that end.</p></li>
<li><p>Elevate the constraint</p>
<p>“Elevating the constraint” means increasing the capacity of the
constraint, which, given that everything is already subordinated to
the constraint, will immediately increase the capacity of the
overall system.</p></li>
<li><p>If elevating the constraint makes <em>something else</em> the constraint,
go back to step 1, but prevent inertia from becoming the
constraint.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These five focusing steps are the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">Goldratt’s Theory of
Constraints</a>. I
have never come across a principle that states “overwhelm the
bottleneck”. In fact the only Theory of Constraints related
references that I found to to “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22overwhelm%20the%20constraint%22">overwhelm the
constraint</a>”
or “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22overwhelm+the+bottleneck%22">overwhelm the
bottleneck</a>”
suggest that “overwhelming the bottleneck” is a <em>negative</em> thing.
“Overwhelming the bottleneck” is what happens when you <em>don’t</em>
subordinate everything to the bottleneck and the bottleneck has
difficulty running at full capacity because of that.</p>
<p>But perhaps I’m being too harsh. Perhaps it’s a simple slip of the
tweet and by “overwhelm the bottleneck” Petersen meant “exploit the
bottleneck”. But failure already occurred at step 1: identify the
constraint. So why do I disagree that yard space and empty trucks are
the bottleneck? Because although finding more yard space for
containers will allow more containers to be taken off ships – and
therefore more goods to come into the country – it will not increase
the steady state capacity of the system.</p>
<p>In the absence of ships taking containers <em>away</em> from the US there
will be an increase in US “container inventory”. <em>The Goal</em> goes to
great pains to explain why, although you always need small buffers to
minimise disruptive shocks, especially in front of the constraint,
inventory should be <em>reduced</em> not increased! The most obvious reason
to reduce inventory in this case is that empty containers should be
sent where they are most needed: China, where they are filled with
goods destined for the US. Empty containers should be piling up where
they are needed (China) not where they are redundant (the US). In
response to <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543801194024961">Petersen’s claim that the nation needs more space for
empty
containers</a>
his followers contacted their elected representatives and subsequently
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451673736877428742">more space was found for empty
containers</a>.
That space will fill up without solving the root problem. As soon as
there are too few empty containers in China the problem with manifest
again.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-constraint">The actual constraint</h2>
<p>So what do I think the actual constraint is and what should be done
about it? Let’s go through the Five Focusing Steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identify the constraint: It seems to me that the constraint is the
shipping of empty containers to where they are actually needed,
China and other origins of US imports.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploit the constraint: make sure that no ship leaves an overloaded
port without as many containers as it can carry. If that requires
increasing the fee paid to shipping companies then so be it. If
transporting empty containers is dangerous then find a way around
it. Maybe you can fill empty containers with scrap metal or sand.</p></li>
<li><p>Subordinate everything to the constraint: only allow one container
off a ship for each container that you have just put <em>on</em> a ship.
Only allow a truck to bring a container to a port if there is a
ship waiting to take it.</p></li>
<li><p>Elevate the constraint: perhaps unladen ships that would not have
otherwise been sent to US ports can be diverted there to pick up
empty containers and take them to China.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, if the constraint has been broken then it’s back to
business-as-usual for the ports, Flexport and international
commerce. There are surely some new constraints but I’m not
qualified to say what they are. I haven’t read the right book.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-burden-the-constraint-even-more">How to burden the constraint even more</h2>
<p>The Long Beach port chief <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/long-beach-port-chief-e2-80-98shop-early-e2-80-99-as-snarls-to-last-all-year/ar-AAPNUS5">has admonished consumers to “shop
early”</a>
for the holiday season. Spiking demand exactly when the system seems
unable to cope seems like the opposite of the best thing to do. On
the other hand perhaps he knows exactly how sticky consumer behaviour
is and that customers won’t actually start buying for a few weeks, by
which time he’s confident the slowdown will have been resolved.
Perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don’t actually know the right way for Flexport to solve the
difficulties it faces; I don’t know enough about the details of its
business. But I do know that, despite recommending <em>The Goal</em> as “the
most important business book ever written”, what Petersen publicly
wrote on Twitter does not align with the lessons of that book.</p>
<h2 id="addendum-on-marketing">Addendum on marketing</h2>
<p>Intriguingly, each of Petersen’s tweets starts with the same
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Yesterday/Last night we did a thing …”</li>
<li>“Here’s a thread about what I/we learned”</li>
<li>“Firstly, the people we spoke to said we were the first company ever
to do this particular good thing …”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure if this is standard marketing copy or something Flexport
devised themselves.</p>
