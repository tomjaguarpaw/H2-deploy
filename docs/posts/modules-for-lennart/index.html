  <h3>modules-for-lennart</h3>
  <h1 id="faking-modules-in-haskell-via-implicit-parameters">Faking modules in Haskell via implicit parameters</h1>
<p>Many years ago <a href="http://augustss.blogspot.se/2008/12/somewhat-failed-adventure-in-haskell.html">Lennart Augustsson wrote about the difficulty of
faking an ML-module-like structure in
Haskell</a>.
The aim is to define an abstract “signature” of types and operations,
allow users to write derived functionality based on this signature,
and then later instantiate the derived functionality by providing an
instantiation for the signature.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example where the module signature declares a
string-like and a double-like type, and declares operations to
concatenate the strings and to “show” the doubles by converting them
to strings. Lennart’s overall idea is to write something like the
following.</p>
<pre><code>-- Our module &quot;signature&quot; represented by a package of operations
-- parametrised on types
data DOps xstring xdouble = DOps {
   (+++) :: xstring -&gt; xstring -&gt; xstring,
   xshow :: xdouble -&gt; xstring
   }

-- Class for passing the package of operations to our derived
-- functions
class (IsString xstring, Num xdouble) =&gt; Ops xstring xdouble where
   ops :: DOps xstring xdouble

-- Derived datatypes parametrised on the types introduced by our
-- module
data Person xstring xdouble = Person {
   firstName :: xstring,
   lastName  :: xstring,
   height    :: xdouble
   }

-- Derived functions use the `Ops` class to receive the package of
-- operations
display :: (Ops xstring xdouble) =&gt;
           Person xstring xdouble -&gt; xstring
display p = let DOps{..} = ops
            in  firstName p +++ &quot; &quot; +++ lastName p
                            +++ &quot; &quot; +++ xshow (height p + 1)

-- Instantiate the signature by providing concrete types and
-- operations
instance Ops String Double where
   ops = DOps (++) show</code></pre>
<p>This is actually a partially decent solution. The drawback that
Lennart points out is that having to mention the type parameters
everywhere is an impediment to modularity. In particular, if we need
to add another datatype to our module every single call site needs to
be updated to reflect that change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because <code>Ops</code> is only parametrised on <code>xstring</code> and
<code>xdouble</code> we cannot provide two different packages of functions with
the same concrete types.</p>
<p>The obvious trick to try to get around these two problems is
identifying the typeclass using a single parameter, like the following</p>
<pre><code>class (IsString (XString t), Num (XDouble t)) =&gt; Ops t where
   type XString t :: *
   type XDouble t :: *
   (+++) :: XString t -&gt; XString t -&gt; XString t
   xshow :: XDouble t -&gt; XString t

data Person t = Person {
   firstName :: XString t,
   lastName  :: XString t,
   height    :: XDouble t
   }

data Basic

instance Ops Basic where
   type XString Basic = String
   type XDouble Basic = Double
   (+++) = (++)
   xshow = show

display :: Ops t =&gt; Person t -&gt; XString t
display p = let DOps{..} = ops
            ...</code></pre>
<p>However, this has instance resolution problems. There is not
necessarily a unique instance to use to unpack the operations. There
may be many <code>t0</code>s that satisfy <code>XString t0 = XString t</code> (as well as
the other necessary type equalities inside the function) and in those
cases <code>Ops t0</code> would do just as well as the <code>Ops t</code> instance.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-parameters-to-the-rescue">Implicit parameters to the rescue</h2>
<p>I don’t know if since Lennart wrote his post there have been type
system improvements that would allow him to achieve his aim with small
adjustments to his approach based on typeclasses and type families.
<a href="http://augustss.blogspot.se/2008/12/abstraction-continues-i-got-several.html">In a subsequent
post</a>
Lennart mentions that Wehr and Chakravarty introduced a concept of
“abstract associated types” that might help with the problem. That
functionality doesn’t exist in any Haskell compiler though, as far as
I know.</p>
<p>Still, there is a related approach to this problem based on another
Haskell extension. Perhaps surprisingly, replacing the typeclass
constraint with an implicit parameter seems to do the trick! Here’s
the proof.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies, ImplicitParams, OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}

import Data.String (IsString)

type family XString t
type family XDouble t

data DOps t = DOps {
  (+++!) :: XString t -&gt; XString t -&gt; XString t,
  xshowOp  :: XDouble t -&gt; XString t
}

(+++) :: (?ops :: DOps t) =&gt; XString t -&gt; XString t -&gt; XString t
(+++) = (+++!) ?ops

xshow :: (?ops :: DOps t) =&gt; XDouble t -&gt; XString t
xshow = xshowOp ?ops

data Person t = Person {
  firstName :: XString t,
  lastName  :: XString t,
  height    :: XDouble t
}

-- We don't need to provide a type signature but the inferred one
-- is a bit messy
--
-- displayI
--  :: (Num (XDouble t1), IsString (XString t1), ?ops::DOps t,
--      XString t ~ XString t1, XDouble t ~ XDouble t1) =&gt;
--     Person t1 -&gt; XString t1
display p = firstName p +++ &quot; &quot; +++ lastName p
                        +++ &quot; &quot; +++ xshow (height p + 1)

-- We can provide a nicer type signature
display' :: (Num (XDouble t), IsString (XString t), ?ops::DOps t)
         =&gt; Person t -&gt; XString t
display' = display

-- We need NoMonomorphismRestriction to be able to do this without
-- a type sig
display'' = display'</code></pre>
<p>The key observation is that there is no ambiguity problem because we
are passing (implicitly) a single specific package of operations to
<code>display</code> which is used by each “module” function call in its body.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach uses the maligned implicit parameters. Despite that is
this a decent approach to getting some of the benefits of modules in
Haskell?</p>
<p>This is certainly not anything close to a module system, but does it
shed some light on the issue?</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-disambiguation">A simple disambiguation</h2>
<p>I’ve also discovered that a simple disambiguation can make the
single-parameter version work.</p>
